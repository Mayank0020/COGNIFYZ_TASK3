# Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python notebook that uses Random Forest Model, Gaussian Naive Bayes Model, Support Vector Machine Model, and Logistic Regression Model and these are used to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.

## Contents

The repository contains the following file:-

1.  task_3.ipynb : A jupyter notebook including the code of the Logistic Regression Model, SVM, Gaussian NB and RF
2.  requirements.txt : A text file containing the libraries used to create this project
3.  Dataset .csv : CSV file cotaining the aggregate rating and features of multiple restaurants

## Getting Started :-

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required python libraries from requirments.txt
3. Open the task_3.ipynb on your system and run the file

## Results :-

The performance of this model is calculated using accuracy, recall and Precision

## Contributing :-

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknoledgment :-

- The dataset was obtained from cognifyz technology company
- This project was inspired by various online tutorials and courses on machine learning and data science.
